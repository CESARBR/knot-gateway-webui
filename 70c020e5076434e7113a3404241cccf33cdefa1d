Which one is better:\n\nUpdate README\nUpdate README\nUpdate README\n\nor\n\nAdd build instructions to README\nAdd install intructions to README\nRemove no longer valid deploy instructions from README\n\nIn this case, the message you wrote below is both descriptive and succinct to fit as the commit title.",
