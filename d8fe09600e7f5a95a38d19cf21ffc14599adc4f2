      "message": "This change is necessary in this patch since the `signupFiware()` was expecting a hashed password in the credentials object. I\u0027ve changed the original object removing the hash in the assignment in order to sign in on the cloud. After that, I just hashed the password to do the `signupMeshblu()` and I forgot to do the same for the `signupFiware()`.",
